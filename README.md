# CI/CD Workshop (Notely)

![badge](https://github.com/johnleoclaudio/learn-cicd-starter/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Recap:

- Set up a continuous integration pipeline with GitHub Actions that ensures new PRs pass certain checks before they are merged to main:
  - Unit tests pass
  - Formatting checks pass
  - Linting checks pass
  - Security checks pass
- Configured a cloud-based SQLite database hosted on Turso
- Set up a continuous deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions that does the following whenever changes are merged into main:
  - Builds a new server binary
  - Builds a new Docker image for the server
  - Pushes the Docker image to the Google Artifact Registry
  - Deploys a new Cloud Run revision with the new image and serves the app to the public internet

## Local Development

Make sure you're on Go version 1.22+.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following contents:

```bash
PORT="8080"
```

Run the server:

```bash
go build -o notely && ./notely
```

*This starts the server in non-database mode.* It will serve a simple webpage at `http://localhost:8080`.

You do *not* need to set up a database or any interactivity on the webpage yet. Instructions for that will come later in the course!

lmao
